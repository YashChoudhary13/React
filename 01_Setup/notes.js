// REACT is made of mainly two libraries - REACT-DOM and REACT-NATIVE
// REACT-DOM is used for web applications
// REACT-NATIVE is used for mobile applications

// NPM is node package manager. Sometimes you want to execute a package without installing it, then you can use npx

// npm create vite@latest - to create react using vite bundler
// npx create-react-app nameinsmallcasesofthefolder
// First you have to go to the directory where you have package.json file, then you can run the command npm run start
// With react you have problem with SEO because in HTML file there's only root and everything is in js
// devDependencies are the packages that are only needed for development, not for production. It does not go into the production build.

// package-lock.json - is basically a package.json with locked stable versions of dependencies
// REACT FLOW
// There's only one index file in public folder, and everything happens in that one page that's why its called Single Page Application
// Components and functions that we import/export to main.jsx should start with Capital letter and all component function files should be .jsx in vite. These are best practices
// In create method, we can keep both js and jsx but according to convention, we use jsx if the file is returning some HTML, and js if its only some javascript code.

// We can use variables in jsx using {} in innerHTML.
