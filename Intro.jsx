// Why learn React?
// hype, job, trend, build UI
// makes easy to manage and build complex front end

// Why should I learn?
// After mastering JS, most project don't need react in Initial phase

// Why react was created
// Phantom Message problem

// State - JS , UI - DOM
// There should be sync between both

// React is a library, not framework (framework has strict rules like military and Library has more freedom more like a cool dude)
// core of React (state or UI Manipulation, JSX -JS and HTML in one file)
// How to propogate changes - Hooks
// Reusing of component - Properties (key : value)

// Additional add-on to React
/*  - Router
    - State Management
        - Redux , Redux toolkit, zustand, context API
    - Class based component
        - Legacy code
    - BAAS apps (Backend as a Service)

   After React
    - React is no complete solution, no SEO, browser render of JS problem, no routing
    - Framework - NextJS, Gatsby , Remix
